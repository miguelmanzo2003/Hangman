# Hangman
Our group (SMLD) had decided to work on a hangman as our idea for the final project in this class. We have 
all played the game or heard about it when we were young and it was an interesting game to play. We wanted to 
do something innovative as this was the last project and considering it was group work we wanted to do something 
fun. We started brainstorming ideas about how we could code this game and what types and functions we would need 
for this project to be possible. We got together outside of class and started working on the code on paper before
typing it on IntelliJ. We thought of different ways on how we could make the code work and running. We encountered 
several issues with the loops at the start. We looked back at previous assignments from CSC 210 and implemented 
certain ideas from the past projects.
